## International Football Results Analysis

Data (Pandas) analysis of international football results from 1872 to 2020.

The base data (‘results.csv’) was obtained from the following Kaggle thread - https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017 

No Kaggle notebooks from this thread were viewed prior to me undertaking my analysis.

Additional data was sourced from - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_finals
